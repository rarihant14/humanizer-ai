# 🧠 Humanizer AI
### Explainable, Memory-Driven AI Text Humanization

Humanizer AI is an **agentic AI system** that rewrites AI-generated text to sound more **human, natural, and conversational**.

Unlike simple paraphrasers, this project uses **sentence-by-sentence rewriting**, **multi-agent reasoning**, **style memory**, and **explainable traces** to show *how* and *why* text changes.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧬 LangGraph Multi-Agent Flow
- Sentence Rewrite Agent  
- Flow Enhancer Agent  
- Meaning Validation Agent (Gemini)  
- Scoring Agent (burstiness & realism)

### 🧠 Memory-Based Style Learning
- Learns writing patterns over time  
- Adapts sentence length and tone  
- Persists style across runs  

### 🔍 Explainability
- Agent reasoning trace visible in UI  
- Meaning-preservation checks  
- Agent disagreement detection  

### ✏️ What Changed Highlighting
- Sentence-level difference detection  
- Highlights modified vs unchanged lines  

### 🎨 Clean Dark UI
- Copyable output box  
- Funny but sensible loading messages  
- Developer-friendly interface

## ⚠️ Important Note on Model Outputs

> **Model outputs may vary between runs.**

This is expected behavior because:
- LLMs are probabilistic by design  
- Temperature introduces controlled creativity  
- Flow enhancement adds natural variation  
- Model versions may change over time  

This project prioritizes **human-like variation over deterministic output**.
